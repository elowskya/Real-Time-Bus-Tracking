<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

tracking the bus route from MIT and Harvard.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clone the repository into your local environment</li>
<li>Navigate to https://account.mapbox.com/ and create an account</li>
<li>Copy the Default public token or generate your own</li>
<li>Open the mapanimation.js file and add your token in the <your key here></li>
<li>Open the index.html file</li>
<li>Right click and select 'Open Default browser' to open the project in your default browser. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Roadmap of future improvements</h3>
<p>Implement GPS tracking and use that to account for the time interval from the bus moving
from one spot to the next in order to have it be real time data</p>
